# Machine Learning -Project---Cupcake vs Muffin Classification using SVM

This project uses the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to identify whether a recipe is a cupcake, or a muffin based on its ingredients. The dataset includes details on ingredients such as flour, milk, sugar, butter, egg, baking powder, vanilla, and salt.

Overview:

1.	Data Loading: The dataset is imported from an Excel file into a pandas dataframe for further analysis.
2.	Data Processing and EDA: Using seaborn and matplotlib, visualizations are created to explore relationships between ingredients and recipe types (cupcakes or muffins).
3.	Model Training & Evaluation: The dataset is trained with SVM from the scikit-learn library, using hyperplanes and support vectors to separate the classes.
4.	Model Fitting & Testing: The model is fitted using a linear SVC kernel function, and its performance is evaluated by predicting recipe types with different ingredient combinations.
5.	Conclusion: The project results are visualized, and the model's effectiveness in classifying recipes based on ingredients is demonstrated.


This project showcases how machine learning can be applied to real-world problems, such as differentiating between recipe types using ingredient data. It highlights the SVM algorithm's ability to classify complex data and lays the groundwork for further machine learning exploration and application.
